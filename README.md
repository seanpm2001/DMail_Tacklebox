# [DMail](https://github.com/seanpm2001/DMail/) Tacklebox

# Part of the [DSuite](https://github.com/seanpm2001/DSuite/)

> **Note** This software component is in Alpha development. It has not reached Beta yet, and is not ready for public usage.

## General description

🧰️✉️🪱️ The DMail tacklebox is a separate email folder that holds phishing attempts (known as lures) it is separate from the spam folder, the inbox, and other folders.

## Lures

Phishing attempts stored in the tacklebox will be referred to as lures, as that is what they are and what they are trying to do: they are trying to lure you in. Credit to [Vern C. Myrick](https://github.com/inverno4/) for this naming idea (specifically the part about the word 'lure')

## Development

### Not yet ready for public use

This project is still in the Alpha phase. It is not functional yet, and is not ready for public use.

### Programming

The DMail Tacklebox is written in 3 languages: D, R, and Red.

- D is used to write the general software and backend
- Red is used to write the user interface and interpreter
- R is used for data analysis, mainly to decide what is a phishing attempt and what isn't.

### Implementations

The Tacklebox is currently only being implemented in 1 email service:

- [DMail](https://github.com/seanpm2001/DMail/)

I am hoping the idea gets widespread adoption.

#### Desired adopters

- [ProtonMail](https://proton.me/mail/) - Has not yet accepted the idea
